Known Issues
------------
- occasional invalid http requests for foo.xml instead of foo.mov
  (could this be the pano.swf player? how to tell it to stop?)
- can't use more than one instance on a page, since a unique id is
  use to place the Flash embed code
- shortcodes not removed from the_excerpt(), this is due in part to the
  shortcode API design, it does not run do_shortcodes() on the_excerpt.
  Workaround: place panos in blog posts AFTER a more tag


Future Enhancements and Features
--------------------------------

- integrate with www.krpano.com
- use with flat JPG files ?
- permit web owner to turn autorotation on or off
